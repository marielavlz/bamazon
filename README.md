# bamazon

## Bamazon Customer JS. This allows a user to check available products and place an order. The table then is updated after the user finishes their purchase to reflect the new inventory. 

Here there are initially 100 strawberries, but after purchasing 50 strawberries, there are now 50 left. The same with the 10 sundresses.
